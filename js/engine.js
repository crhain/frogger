/* Engine.js
 * This file provides the game loop functionality (update entities and render),
 * draws the initial game board on the screen, and then calls the update and
 * render methods on your player and enemy objects (defined in your app.js).
 *
 * A game engine works by drawing the entire game screen over and over, kind of
 * like a flipbook you may have created as a kid. When your player moves across
 * the screen, it may look like just that image/character is moving or being
 * drawn but that is not the case. What's really happening is the entire "scene"
 * is being drawn over and over, presenting the illusion of animation.
 *
 * This engine is available globally via the Engine variable and it also makes
 * the canvas' context (ctx) object globally available to make writing app.js
 * a little simpler to work with.

/*This function declaration is very intersting.  It is doing several things:
 1. it is being executed immediately because it is wraped in pranthesis
 2. it takes a paramater global that is being set to the keyword this (see end of declartion)
 3. this is defaulting to global scope, so effectively global is like using this with reference to
    global scope!
 4.  it creates a closure for all functions within it.  Even after it is finished running, the
     variables declared within will remain, only accesible to functions within unless they are made global
 5.  main() function will continually fire because it is wraped in requestAnimationFrame
